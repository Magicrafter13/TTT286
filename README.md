# Assembling
For this project I use the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0b.
I'm sure other versions will work, but here's a link to this version if you want to try it out yourself. [MASM 6](https://winworldpc.com/product/macro-assembler/6x)

You may use the provided 'compile.bat' if you don't know which commands to use, however \<path_to_masm\>\BIN and \<path_to_masm\>BINB must be in your system path.

This program should assemble and run perfectly fine in DOSBox.
